To get started with oracle framework you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up your development environment:

## Downloading the project

If you are not familiar with git (we recommend that you learn the basics but for now you don't need to if you are not a developer) you can just go ahead and download our repository using this link: [download](https://github.com/oracle-framework/oracle-framework/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Once you have downloaded it, unzip it, and you're ready to install the dependencies using npm or Yarn as described below.

## Cloning the Repository

If you are familiar with or want to learn git you can just clone the repository by following these instructions.

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the oracle framework project.

3. Run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oracle-framework/oracle-framework.git
```

4. Once the cloning process is complete, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd oracle-framework
```

## Installing Dependencies

oracle framework uses either npm or Yarn as its package manager. You can choose the one you prefer based on your existing setup and familiarity.

### Using npm

1. In the project directory, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Wait for the installation process to complete. npm will download and install all the necessary packages and their dependencies.

### Using Yarn

1. If you prefer to use Yarn, run the following command in the project directory to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Yarn will resolve and install all the required packages and their dependencies.

Once the installation process is finished, you should have a fully functional oracle framework development environment set up on your machine.
