To set up and run oracle framework, your development environment should meet the following requirements:

## Operating System

* Windows, macOS, or Linux

* oracle framework is platform-agnostic and can be run on any operating system that supports Node.js

## Node.js

* node v20.16.0 or higher.

    * We highly recommend using nvm to manage Node versions https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

## Package Manager

* You can use either `npm` or `yarn` but we recommend using `yarn`.

    * If you are going to use yarn but don't have it installed in your system the easiest way to install it is by running the following command: 

    ```bash
    npm install --global yarn
    ```
