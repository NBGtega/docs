oracle is an open-source TypeScript framework designed to help developers quickly create and manage AI-powered social media personas. These personas, or agents, can authentically engage with followers across various platforms like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord.

The framework leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate human-like responses, allowing agents to maintain consistent personalities and interact with users in a natural, context-aware manner. Oracle streamlines the process of building and deploying AI agents, making it easier for developers to focus on crafting unique personas and engaging content.

## Key Features of oracle framework include:

* **AI-Powered Interactions**: oracle utilizes LLMs to generate responses and posts that closely resemble human communication patterns, enabling agents to maintain coherent and engaging conversations with users.

* **Personality System**: Developers can define each agent's character, tone, and behavior through a simple configuration file, allowing for the creation of diverse and compelling personas.

* **Multi-Modal Support**: In addition to text-based interactions, oracle agents can generate and handle image and voice content, enhancing the richness and interactivity of the user experience.

* **Platform Integration**: The framework supports popular social media platforms such as Twitter, Telegram, and Discord out of the box, with more integrations planned for the future.

* **Engagement Tools**: oracle provides built-in features for auto-posting, replying to mentions, and handling user interactions, enabling agents to maintain an active and responsive presence on social media.

By abstracting away the complexities of working with LLMs and social media APIs, oracle framework empowers developers to create compelling, AI-driven social media personas with minimal setup and configuration.
